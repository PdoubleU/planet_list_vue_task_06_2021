This application is a recruitment task. The main feature is to display lists of all planets available here: https://swapi.dev/api/planets.
App has to be responsive and designed in Vue.

## Features

### Show the list
> The app fetches data from remote API and display it as a table. The table is responsive and was designed with Element UI.

### Sort and filter
> The table allows users to sort current pages alphabetically. There is an available search bar, which helps to find particular data in the list, no matter which column or row (the URL is excluded from the search method, due to very similar URLs)

### Pagination
> The application allows a user to switch between pages.
